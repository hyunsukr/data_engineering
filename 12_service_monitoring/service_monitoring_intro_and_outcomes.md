## Service Monitoring Motivation
To ensure every deployed model is functioning properly, it needs ongoing monitoring.  
We will learn why this degradation happens, and discuss how to detect and prevent it.

### Learning Outcomes
1. Give reasons why a model might degrade over time
2. Distinguish between observability and monitoring
3. Describe how an ML system can be monitored
4. Describe different deployment strategies:
   - red-black deployment
   - blue-green deployment

### TO-DOs
- Take Quiz
- Review Lecture Notes
- Journaling
- Live Session
