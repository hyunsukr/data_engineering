    "## In this lab you will create reusable functions in a library to be shared via github and using python's pip\n",
    "### The goals of this lab are\n",
    "* To reduce cut and paste, and duplicated effort by sharing a library of common functions\n",
    "* Use asserts and some of the best practices presented in class to create a readable and mantainable library\n",
    "\n",
    "### For this lab you'll be provided\n",
    "* A skeletal github repo to use as a template (the point of the exercies is not how to use github, but we'll be relying on a couple of its features)\n",
    "* Steps for setting up a tagged release in github which will allow you to pip install by version\n",
    "* Instructions for testing the pip install\n",
    "\n",
    "### The core of the lab will be to set up a set of functions that can then be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "* You'll be given a description of functions to write in the shared package\n",
    "* The end goal is for your package to install and pass a set of tests that will run against your functions\n",
