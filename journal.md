### Journaling Instructions

The purpose of this exercise is to track your learning and growth through this course. You will add an entry for each Module (ideally on a weekly basis). You will submit your journal over the course of the term, and it will grow with your new entries.

Each entry should answer these questions:

- What were some things you learned in the module?
- What do you think were the most important concepts?
- What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?
- Which parts did you enjoy?

Each entry should:

Use full sentences to show good writing and clear thought process
Be limited to one or two paragraphs (it should be fairly brief)
File format: Use a Word doc or similar. Recycle the same file throughout the course. Action Item: Write a journal entry for this Module. It will be submitted later.

## Module 1

What were some things you learned in the module?

- Even though I thought I had experience with CLI and terminal, I was still finding new commands / flags that can be utilized. I.E. extracting from tar. I would always have to look this up. Although I will probably need to look this up again later, it was a great refresher!

What do you think were the most important concepts?

- I think the most important concept was understanding the power of the CLI. Many of the features of the cli are overlooked because they can be done inside a script or in a certain language, but this lesson provided a new perspective in the data engineering pipeline.

- What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?

Honestly, I felt that some of the instructions were unclear at first. I had to read multiple times what was actually required for the lab. I think starting off with simple scripts and explaining / asking what flags are needed to extract would have been helpful. 

- Which parts did you enjoy?

I enjoyed the lab because it was a great refresher of the cli. Normally I only use the cli to either 1) run a script to output some data processing file or 2) build projects 3) navigate, but it was nice to see and relearn the new extraction features.

## Module 2

What were some things you learned in the module?

- It was interesting to see how tags / and making a python library was. It is very common to install packages through pip, but actually I never done it with my functions. It was cool to see how the whole process was.

What do you think were the most important concepts?

- I think the most important concept in this module was learning to manipulate git. No matter how fancy of a package you make with out the procedure to set up your repo, that library will never be useable by doing pip install.

- What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?

I think making the library more flexible would have been interesting. Maybe even incorporated oher packages as dependencies in the setup.py file.

Which parts did you enjoy?

- I enjoyed trying out the tags and actually installing/testing my package. It was a new experience for me that I found interesting.


## Module 3

What were some things you learned in the module?

- Testing. Up until this point my unit tests for class/work were very static. I didn't know such decorations existed in pytest. 

What do you think were the most important concepts?

- How critical testing is. While I was making tests I found that instead of testing just for functionality there can be many tests that can be configured such as wrong user input/expected wrong behavior that should be accounted for.

- What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?

I think creating some functions that are incorrect would have been interesting for the lab. Sometimes while making tests I find myself going back to my code. It would have been interesting if a function was incorrect and we had to try to find out way back to the logical incorrectness of a function.

- Which parts did you enjoy?

I really enjoyed the decorations of pytests. It was a great learning activity to get used to all the possiblities of pytest. 

## Module 4

What were some things you learned in the module?

- Makefiles. I would do all of this by hand just for the sake of doing them. I would look at it all individually, but learning about makefiles was great for looking at all components of a project/library together.

What do you think were the most important concepts?

- How to organize the makefile. We focused on tests and linux and working with the CLI, but this module brings them all together.

What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?

- Nothing was hard. Clear instructions helped a lot.

Which parts did you enjoy?

- I liked the small debugging session because it made me look at the code more deeper.

## Module 5

What were some things you learned in the module?

- This module was a great refresher or DB design and making ERs.

What do you think were the most important concepts?

- The thought behinding designing a DB. Most of the time people are desinging DBs just for the sake of having something to store their data, but this module was a great introduction to how DB design should really be played out during the software engineering process. 

What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?

- Nothing I would say was very hard. I think it would have been better to go over many examples of designing a database to see how ER diagrams could be mapped to different scenarios. 

Which parts did you enjoy?

- I really liked the lab. It was nice to design a DB for a practical case. It made me really think about how much time we should put into design.

## Module 6

What were some things you learned in the module?

- How much time it took to make a DB with data. The data for the lab took so much time to parse through and insert into the DB. It took a long time for me, which made me work more on insertting the data rather than running queries on the data. 

What do you think were the most important concepts?

- SQL Commands for different scenarios. The questions for the lab were very fun. The creation and loading was a different story.

What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?

- Loading the data from the excel format was incredibly hard since my db design was a little different from the data found in the DB. I feel that it would have been better to either load the data or give a schema with data in that schema to load the DB. Loading the DB took way more time than actually thinking about the queries. 

Which parts did you enjoy?

- I liked the query section of the lab. It was fun to think about how I can accomodate the questions with my db design.

## Module 7

What were some things you learned in the module?

- CircleCI. I would always do CICD in my jobs as a software engineer, but not really for my personal projects. It was nice to see how I can play around with circleCI for CICD with my own projects as well.

What do you think were the most important concepts?

- The importance of CICD and how much it can smooth out the development process. 

What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?

- I think this module was structed great!

Which parts did you enjoy?

- I liked to experience CircleCI. It was fun to see how github can be connected to it. Will probably try it out for my own personal projects now.

- I liked to experience CircleCI. It was fun to see how github can be connected to it. Will probably try it out for my own personal projects now. 

## Module 8

What were some things you learned in the module?

- I have a love hate relationship with containers. I worked with many Cloud Providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. I laugh and cry with each one of them. It was nice to har about containers rather than finding out by myself through documentation and stackoverflow.

What do you think were the most important concepts?

- I actually think the container orchestration and discussion about cloud (aws) was the most important. With all the different Cloud Providers at the race it seemed to be the hot topic. 

What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?

- I think showing examples of some key cloud providers might have been helpful in understanding containers for newcomers. I have experience in both Azure and AWS, but some people may have a hard time understanding what it means to have a container "on the cloud" would mean. 

Which parts did you enjoy?

- Enjoyed the discussions we had in class. I was relieved to see that some people also had original problems with containers and not shutting them off. If it was my bank account and not my companies I would be so broke. 

## Module 9

What were some things you learned in the module?

- I've never heard of Airflow before and found it very interesting. It seemed like a good tool when doing the lab. I feel that there is definetly a learning curve to this tool,b ut am willing to investigate it further.

What do you think were the most important concepts?

- Since I haven't heard of this tool before, it was great to get a overall picture. I was familiar with DAG, but the relationship between DAG and me were shallow. How airflow works and DAG was the most important concept for me.

What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?

- Learning the entire tool within one module seemed to be abit challenging, but after looking at what was suppose to be the lab, I was glad that it wasn't as hard as the previous semesters. 

Which parts did you enjoy?

- I liked the lab the most. It was a great way to get familar with the tool and not too much information thrown all at once.

## Module 10

What were some things you learned in the module?

- The stored procedures in snowflake were very interesting to experiment with.

What do you think were the most important concepts?

- Utilizing snowflake and exploring the versatility of snowflake.

What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?

- Unironically, converting to the classic UI. There were also some challenges in the syntax for javascript and python within the snowflake stored procedure. However, that could be overcome by the documentation.

Which parts did you enjoy?

- I liked writting the procedures. It was interesting to experiment with different languages within snowflake.

## Module 11

What were some things you learned in the module?

- The entirety of DBT. I've actually never heard about it or used it before. It was interesting tool to learn about and it tied in well with the previous module. 

What do you think were the most important concepts?

- Just getting familiary with the tool itself. The use cases and how it can be configured. The lab helped a lot by actually letting us step through the cycle from the beginning.

What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?

- The snowflake configuration changes that needed to be done in order for the communication to take place between dbt and snowflake. It might have been better to focus more on why the changes in the user roles are needed for the tool to run. 

Which parts did you enjoy?

- The lab since it gave a good example of how dbt can be used. 

## Module 12

What were some things you learned in the module?

- The realization that all software will degrade. Development never stops and nothing will be considered "done".

What do you think were the most important concepts?

- The introduction that software will never be done. There are always cases where versions will be degraded/ hardware degradation/ etc. Finding a solution to something doesn't mean that solution will persist forever. You may even run into cases where monitoring will show that an update will be required as well. 

What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?

- There was no lab so no major challenges. 

Which parts did you enjoy?

- The lecture. It was a good closing lecture since almost all our labs and learnings were so intertwined with versioning.
