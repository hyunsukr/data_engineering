## Journaling Instructions

The purpose of this exercise is to track your learning and growth through this course. You will add an entry for each Module (ideally on a weekly basis). You will submit your journal over the course of the term, and it will grow with your new entries.

Each entry should answer these questions:

- What were some things you learned in the module?
- What do you think were the most important concepts?
- What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?
- Which parts did you enjoy?

Each entry should:

Use full sentences to show good writing and clear thought process
Be limited to one or two paragraphs (it should be fairly brief)
File format: Use a Word doc or similar. Recycle the same file throughout the course. Action Item: Write a journal entry for this Module. It will be submitted later.

## Module 1

What were some things you learned in the module?

- Even though I thought I had experience with CLI and terminal, I was still finding new commands / flags that can be utilized. I.E. extracting from tar. I would always have to look this up. Although I will probably need to look this up again later, it was a great refresher!

What do you think were the most important concepts?

- I think the most important concept was understanding the power of the CLI. Many of the features of the cli are overlooked because they can be done inside a script or in a certain language, but this lesson provided a new perspective in the data engineering pipeline.

- What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?

Honestly, I felt that some of the instructions were unclear at first. I had to read multiple times what was actually required for the lab. I think starting off with simple scripts and explaining / asking what flags are needed to extract would have been helpful. 

- Which parts did you enjoy?

I enjoyed the lab because it was a great refresher of the cli. Normally I only use the cli to either 1) run a script to output some data processing file or 2) build projects 3) navigate, but it was nice to see and relearn the new extraction features.
